# TensorFlow Graph

Download and extract an object detection graph to this folder from the [TensorFlow Detection Model Zoo](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/detection_model_zoo.md#coco-trained-models).

I am using the `faster_rcnn_inception_v2_coco` model.
